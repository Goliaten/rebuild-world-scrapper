- mechanical [^1]
- has an optical camouflage[^1]
	- when it turns down, it looks like light is flickering[^1]
- it is `huge`[^1]
- has a cannon which fires with thundering sound[^1]
- its cannon fires big explosive warheads, which can demolish a building, and leave a deafening sound from its huge explosion[^2] (although those buildings have already been rubble in this instance); and make surrounding buildings tremble from the impact for some time[^3]
