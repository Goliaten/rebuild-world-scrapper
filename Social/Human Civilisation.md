# General Remarks
- Humanity has spent many years gathering old world relics and reconstructing human civilization[^2]
- Certain relics are so valuable, that cities can be bought with them[^4]
- Monsters are not fully undestood even by those that specialise in monsters[^6]
- Old world equipment is much more powerful than anything humanity can currently produce.[^7]
# Far eastern part
- There are countless [[Corporate Cities]].[^1]
# Hunters
- Hunters risk life in wastelands for money and fame[^3].
- As long as they survive and are competent enough, they can constantly keep growing with better gear and technology[^5].
- With Old World weapons, they can be more powerful than a city[^5]
- Hunters register themselves as hunters in hunter offices[^8]
