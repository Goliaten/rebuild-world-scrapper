- they are biological despite weapons growing on their body[^2] 
- Weapons on their back will get stronger as they evolve[^2]

- nanomachines living in their tissue grew weapons from metal ores they ingested[^3]
# Looks
- looks like dog
- 2 meters in length[^1]
- strengthened muscles[^1]
- small canons or rockets or small missile launchers on back[^1]
# Behaviour
- (?) pack behaviour with a pack leader[^2]
