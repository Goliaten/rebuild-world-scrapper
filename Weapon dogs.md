- created to protect the city[^2]
- they are biological despite weapons growing on their body[^2] 
- Weapons on their back will get stronger as they evolve[^2]
- evolved independently from original design to adapt to current conditions[^3]
- nanomachines living in their tissue grew weapons from metal ores they ingested[^3]
- Their weapons are armed with black powder[^4]
- They have an orgain inside their body that produces black powder for their weapons[^4]
- They have a limited capacity for black powder at a time[^4]
- Replenishing black powder takes time[^4]
- They become easier to kill without their weapons active. This doesn't mean they are easy to kill though[^4]
