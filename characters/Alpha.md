- Alpha can appear and disappear at a whim.[^4]
- Alpha is incorporeal[^3]
- Alpha is a being of an "augmented reality"[^1]
- Alpha was in [[Kuzusuhara Street Ruins]] to look for someone to fulfill her request[^2]
- Alpha is willing to abandon the person with old world access if he doesn't listen to her and believe her fully.[^7]
- So beautiful that she's out of place being in slums.[^8]
- She was naked before she met [[Akira]] to attract people's attention and make them less on alert[^10][^11]
